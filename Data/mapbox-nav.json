    "details": "This project was more of a learning experiment to get a grasp of Mapbox API, its uses, features and integration with Unity to generate map and related navigational elements associated with it. Users could input specific locations, landmarks, or general instructions akin to Google Maps functionality. The system would then generate and display the fastest route from the current location to the designated destination."
