They will start at the company as an Intern but by completing the tasks well and on time, will gain experience to get promoted to a junior position. Which they'll have to continue their work journey with more responsibilities and tasks to eventually reach the full developer position. Though this is the general narrative for the game there is a secondary narrative that is around the setting of the game being in hell, in which the player must complete the task well to be turned into a demon and live a normal life in hell or be sent to the pits of hell to be tortured. This is showcased via the art style and subtle hints in the writing."
