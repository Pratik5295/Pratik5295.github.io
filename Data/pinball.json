    "details": "This was a team assignment for our Gameplay Prototyping course at RIT. Developed over the span of a weekend, the group dived deep into designing and implementing mechanics of the game, where you control the level instead of the actual player. This funky project had you rotating the level via controls to guide the ball throughout the level. I was involved with designing the levels associated with the game and structuring the levels in game engine using modular assets. Polishing the game levels for a playable demo involved additional of my tasks."
