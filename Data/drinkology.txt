"details":

"This game started as a solo weekend project and transitions to a group project. Relatively short as it only took around a month to complete the game and release on Play Store. This was a game made during my time at RIT for my masters. Diving deep into the gameplay features and logistics required to make a simple mobile game fun for parties was my primary task. Made use of randomizing value generators for features like shuffling card decks, drawing cards. Wearing multiple hats (other than developer) majorly in the field of game design helped me aquire and expand on my knowledge of game designing."
