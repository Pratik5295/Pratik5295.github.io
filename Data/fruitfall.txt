"details":

"In just 12 hours, I crafted a simple yet engaging mobile game using Unity and C#. In this game, players assume the role of a basket, maneuvering horizontally to catch fruits descending from boxes. However, they must evade falling rocks, as contact with them spells GAME OVER! Structured with three initial levels, the game provides an escalating challenge for players. I independently developed the game from scratch, including all its assets, to deliver a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience.
