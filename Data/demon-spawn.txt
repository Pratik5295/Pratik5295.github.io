    "description": "Play as a lost prince in this action packed 2D metroidvania style game. Explore the dungeons, use fists, bows and arrows to fight a variety of monsters. Feeling a bit overpowered by combat? Let your dark side take over to become a demon temporarily, allowing new and powerful abilities to balance the scales and maybe some into your favor. Solve engaging puzzles to explore all the levels in the game. Test yourself against the boss and defeat him to complete the game demo. One final question - Are you ready?",
