    "description": "Demon Spawn is a 2D action platformer crafted by a team of six individuals for our capstone project. Within the team, I served as the AI programmer, undertaking the responsibility of crafting diverse enemy types, bosses, and their array of behavioral states. To achieve this, I implemented finite state machines and a tactical waypoint system to govern the AIâ€™s decision-making processes and movement patterns."
