Feeling a bit overpowered by combat? Let your dark side take over to become a demon temporarily, allowing new and powerful abilities to balance the scales and maybe some into your favor. Solve engaging puzzles to explore all the levels in the game. Test yourself against the boss and defeat him to complete the game demo. One final question - Are you ready?",

"details":

"For our capstone project in Masters degree, we created a vertical slice of a 2D action platformer featuring a metroidvania style level design. Design and Development of this game took place over the course of 9 months. Working as the AI programmer, I was responsible for designing and developing AI creatures that will challenge the player in combat. The development involved using techniques like Behavior trees, Waypoint system to patrol, Hit and Hurt boxes for combat development. This project was my first experience working in a game development team towards making a polished game. It taught me a lot about game development process, and involved wearing multiple hats to create a smooth and playable experience together."
