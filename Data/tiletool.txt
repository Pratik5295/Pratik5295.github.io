"The project delves into custom tool programming within Unity & C#, aimed at expediting game development processes. In order to facilitate level designers in swiftly exploring their level prototypes, a 3D tile editor tool has been developed. This tool offers the following functionalities: Customizable Tile Palette: Users can create a personalized tile palette by adding tiles of their choice. 3D Grid-Based System: The tool establishes a 3D grid-based system, enhancing the levelâ€™s visibility and enabling users to paint tiles more efficiently. By integrating these features, the tool empowers designers to create levels at a faster pace, thus streamlining the development workflow."
